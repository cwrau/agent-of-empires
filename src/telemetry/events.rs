/// v2 (#1941): added serve-only `auth_mode` / `serve_mode`.

/// v4 (#1931): added `session_pinned` / `session_snoozed` / `session_archived`.

/// v6 (#1933): added the [`CliUsage`] event and retired the `cli`-surface
/// [`ProcessStart`] in favor of it.
/// v7 (#1887): added version-health fields (`data_schema_version`,
/// `update_status`, `update_releases_behind`) to every event.

/// and `usage_snapshot`.
